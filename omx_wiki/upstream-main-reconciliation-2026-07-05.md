# Upstream main reconciliation 2026-07-05

## Purpose

Record the exact upstream merge baseline and fork-preservation checks from the 2026-07-05 reconciliation, so the next upstream sync can start from evidence instead of memory.

## Branches and commits

- Work branch: `codex/upstream-main-reconcile-msi`
- Local pre-merge main baseline: `7794e6c92558955c796f2e991627f365eb306aba`
- Upstream main merged: `bcc3a5b24c1b0da77c7645bb57548b89bf95f59b`
- Merge commit: `6855df8441af73965164b148535c05ceb9085839`
- Merge parents: `7794e6c92558955c796f2e991627f365eb306aba` and `bcc3a5b24c1b0da77c7645bb57548b89bf95f59b`
- Post-merge repair commits: `6d0ea365`, `5e1e71e0`, `72f825d3`, `fb47fe22`
- Published release commit: `84e1f15618264e78315994931b04e65b4dfec5e7`
- Published tag: `aio-coding-hub-v0.60.17`
- Release workflow: https://github.com/FingerCaster/aio-coding-hub/actions/runs/28730171408
- Release URL: https://github.com/FingerCaster/aio-coding-hub/releases/tag/aio-coding-hub-v0.60.17

## Why version 0.60.17 was used

`aio-coding-hub-v0.60.16` already existed and targeted `bd3d03b1bcb558f6fc8c9a94386e1dfeb33eb740`, so the upstream reconciliation could not be published by reusing `0.60.16`. The merged/repaired result was released as `0.60.17`.

## Fork behavior to preserve on future upstream syncs

- Default repo operations to `origin` / `FingerCaster/aio-coding-hub`; use `upstream` only when explicitly syncing upstream.
- Keep `upstream` fetch-only; do not restore an upstream push URL.
- Keep releases manual-only through `workflow_dispatch`.
- Keep updater endpoints and GitHub release links pointed at `FingerCaster/aio-coding-hub`.
- Keep Homebrew tap default pointed at `FingerCaster/homebrew-aio-coding-hub`.
- Do not restore the removed Codex continuation repair UI entry; internal default remains disabled unless intentionally changed.
- Re-run support matrix checks after release workflow or upstream release changes.

## Future upstream sync checklist

1. Fetch current refs: `git fetch origin --prune` and, only for upstream work, `git fetch upstream --prune`.
2. Confirm current fork main: `git rev-parse main origin/main`.
3. Confirm whether the recorded upstream baseline is behind upstream: `git log --oneline bcc3a5b24c1b0da77c7645bb57548b89bf95f59b..upstream/main`.
4. Confirm fork/upstream drift: `git rev-list --left-right --count main...upstream/main`.
5. If `upstream/main` has new commits, create a fresh reconcile branch from `main`, merge `upstream/main`, then resolve conflicts while preserving the fork behavior above.
6. After resolving, run `pnpm check:prepush`, targeted tests for conflict areas, and a release rule check before publishing.
7. If an existing release tag already exists for the current version, bump to the next patch version before release.

## Verification from this sync

- `pnpm check:prepush` passed on local `main` before release.
- Push hook ran `pnpm check:prepush` again and passed.
- Rust tests reported `1897 passed, 0 failed, 3 ignored`.
- Release workflow completed successfully and uploaded 24 release assets including `latest.json`.
- Downloaded `latest.json` reported `"version": "0.60.17"`.

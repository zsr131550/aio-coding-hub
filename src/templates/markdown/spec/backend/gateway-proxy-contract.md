# Gateway Proxy Contract

> What the local gateway does to requests/responses, and what is (not) "passthrough".

---

## Why This Exists

The gateway is **not** a dumb TCP tunnel. It is an application-level proxy that:

- selects providers (failover, circuit breaker, session stickiness)
- rewrites authentication (fail-closed; never leak client-sent tokens upstream)
- applies compatibility rectifiers (Claude thinking fixes, metadata injection, etc.)
- optionally bridges protocols (CX2CC: Anthropic → OpenAI Responses and back)

This document makes those mutations explicit, so "透传/不透传" is not a guess.

---

## High-Level Request Lifecycle (Claude/Codex/Gemini)

```
Client CLI
  → proxy handler (entry / guards / introspection)
    → provider selection (sort mode + session binding)
      → failover loop
        → per-attempt rewrite (auth + protocol bridge + rectifiers)
          → upstream request
            → response handling (stream/non-stream, response fixer, translation)
```

Primary code entrypoints:

- Entry handler: `src-tauri/src/gateway/proxy/handler/mod.rs`
- Failover loop: `src-tauri/src/gateway/proxy/handler/failover_loop/mod.rs`
- Auth injection helper: `src-tauri/src/gateway/util.rs`

---

## Business Architecture Boundary

Treat these as separate domain concepts even if the current provider table
stores them together:

- **Route candidate**: which upstream endpoint(s) can receive traffic
- **Credential strategy**: API key vs OAuth vs inherited/bridge credential
- **Compatibility profile**: vendor-specific header/body quirks for one upstream
- **Protocol bridge**: request/response translation between client protocol and
  upstream protocol

Extension rule:

- Adding a new provider/auth/bridge type should primarily mean registering one
  capability/strategy, not editing scattered `cli_key`, `auth_mode`, and
  `provider_type` branches across UI, commands, and failover helpers.
- Gateway preparation should compose these behaviors into a resolved execution
  plan instead of re-deriving provider meaning from raw strings in multiple
  stages.
- Provider create/save/OAuth-pre-save flows must reuse one canonical payload
  builder so provider-wide business fields cannot drift between entry points.

---

## Provider Selection and Session Binding

Session binding is a preference, not an authorization bypass. A bound provider
can only be reused after the current request has built its eligible provider
candidate list.

Contract:

- Always load the eligible providers for the active or session-bound route mode
  first. For the default provider route, eligibility is `providers.enabled = 1`.
  For a sort-template route, eligibility is `sort_mode_providers.enabled = 1`
  and must not depend on `providers.enabled`.
- Never reinsert a session-bound provider that is missing from the current
  candidate list. Missing means disabled, removed from the mode, deleted, or no
  longer valid for this CLI key.
- If the bound provider is missing, clear the stale session binding and let the
  failover loop continue with the remaining candidates.
- Provider create/save/toggle/delete and sort-template membership flows that
  change routing eligibility must clear the running gateway's route runtime
  state for that CLI key after the database write succeeds. Route runtime state
  includes session bindings plus recent `GW_ALL_PROVIDERS_UNAVAILABLE` errors;
  otherwise the recent-error cache can short-circuit the next request before it
  reaches failover/logging, even though a newly enabled provider is now
  eligible.
- If the bound provider is still present, run circuit-breaker gating before
  applying session preference. An open or cooling-down bound provider must not
  block fallback to later candidates.
- Forced provider selection is a separate explicit override. It must not be
  combined with stale session-binding reinsertion.

Codex-specific note:

- Codex sessions can be derived from `prompt_cache_key`, `previous_response_id`,
  metadata, or deterministic request fingerprints. Treat them exactly like other
  session ids: they preserve continuity only within the current eligible provider
  set.
- Regression tests for Codex provider selection must cover this case: an OAuth
  Team provider is bound to the session, then becomes disabled and circuit-open,
  while a later API-key provider is enabled. The gateway must choose the later
  provider without requiring a manual circuit reset.

### Route Runtime State Invalidation

#### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: a persisted provider or sort-template change can alter the provider
  candidates, candidate order, credentials, upstream endpoint, or active route
  view for a CLI key.

#### 2. Signatures

- App helper:
  `app_gateway_clear_cli_route_runtime_state(app, cli_key) -> GatewayRouteRuntimeClearResult`.
- Runtime helper:
  `GatewayRuntime::clear_cli_route_runtime_state(cli_key) -> GatewayRouteRuntimeClearResult`.
- Result fields: `cleared_sessions: usize`, `cleared_recent_errors: usize`.

#### 3. Contracts

- Clear the target CLI's session bindings after the database write succeeds.
- Clear recent unavailable-error cache entries in the running gateway. The cache
  is currently process-wide, so route-state invalidation may clear entries for
  other CLI keys too.
- Do not reset circuit-breaker state here. Circuit reset remains an explicit
  user/admin operation; the fix is to let newly eligible providers be tried.

#### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- No running gateway -> return zero counts and keep the persisted change.
- Provider not found during delete -> return the existing DB_NOT_FOUND error and
  do not clear runtime state.
- Cache clear failure is not expected; poisoned locks must use the shared
  lock-or-recover path already used by gateway runtime state.

#### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: enable a new Codex provider after the only previous provider cached
  `GW_ALL_PROVIDERS_UNAVAILABLE`; the next request reaches failover and logs.
- Base: reordering providers clears sticky order and recent unavailable cache.
- Bad: only clear session bindings; recent-error cache still short-circuits the
  next request before request-start/log writes.

#### 6. Tests Required

- Unit-test the runtime helper clears target CLI sessions and recent-error cache
  together.
- Regression-test default provider routing and active sort-template routing
  separately; sort templates must not depend on `providers.enabled`.

#### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong: `provider_set_enabled` calls only `clear_cli_session_bindings(cli_key)`.

Correct: provider and sort-template eligibility changes call the route runtime
state helper so sessions and recent unavailable-error cache are invalidated
together.

## What Is Always Modified (Not Passthrough)

### 1) Authentication (Fail-Closed)

The gateway **always clears** client-sent auth headers before sending upstream, then injects
credentials based on the selected provider:

- clears: `Authorization`, `x-api-key`, `x-goog-api-key`, `x-goog-api-client`
- injects:
  - Codex: `Authorization: Bearer <provider_credential>`
  - Claude (API key mode): `x-api-key: <provider_key>` (default)
  - Claude (OAuth mode): `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` + required Claude headers via adapter
  - Gemini: `Authorization: Bearer <oauth_token>` OR `x-goog-api-key: <api_key>` depending on credential shape

**Rationale**: prevent accidental token leakage when clients send their own credentials.

OAuth client classification contract:

- Public/desktop PKCE clients must not depend on a bundled shared
  `client_secret` as a security boundary.
- Persist `oauth_client_secret` only for user-supplied confidential clients or
  truly secret server-managed integrations.
- Refresh flows must resolve the **effective upstream credential** through the
  OAuth adapter before persisting or returning it, so adapter-specific token
  rules stay consistent across login, proactive refresh, limits fetch, and
  reactive 401 refresh.

### 2) Hop-by-Hop Headers

Hop-by-hop/proxy headers are stripped before forwarding (HTTP correctness):

- e.g. `connection`, `proxy-authorization`, `transfer-encoding`, `upgrade`, etc.

### 3) Content-Encoding When Body Mutates

If the gateway rewrites the request body, it will remove `Content-Encoding`
to avoid sending a compressed body with stale encoding metadata.

---

## Conditional Mutations (Depends on CLI / Provider / Response)

### Claude: API Key vs OAuth vs CX2CC

#### A) API Key mode (`auth_mode=api_key`, `source_provider_id=NULL`)

- Default auth scheme: `x-api-key`
- Fallback auth scheme (once): if upstream returns **401/403**, retry with:
  `Authorization: Bearer ...` (and remove `x-api-key`) to support strict relays.
- Observability: emits `special_settings_json` entries of type `claude_auth_injection`.

This is the only place where "same key, different auth header" can occur.

#### B) OAuth mode (`auth_mode=oauth`)

Uses the OAuth adapter to inject upstream headers (Claude-specific beta flags, UA/stainless headers, etc).

Important: OAuth mode should **not** send `x-api-key` upstream.

#### C) CX2CC bridge (`source_provider_id=...`)

CX2CC is **explicitly non-passthrough**:

- request: translate Anthropic Messages JSON into OpenAI Responses JSON
- routing: upstream becomes the **source** (Codex) provider, not the Claude bridge provider
- headers: strip Claude-specific headers when bridging `claude → codex`
- response: translate OpenAI responses/SSE back into Anthropic-shaped responses/SSE

This mode is isolated by `source_provider_id` and does not modify non-bridge providers.

---

## Body Rectifiers

The gateway may rewrite request JSON in a small number of controlled situations:

- **Billing header rectifier**: removes `x-anthropic-billing-header: ...` blocks from `system`
  (some non-Anthropic upstreams reject them with 400).
- **Metadata user_id injection**: injects `metadata.user_id` for `/v1/messages` when missing.
- **Model mapping**: rewrites model name based on provider slot config (body/query/path).
- **Thinking rectifiers**: after upstream 400 indicates a thinking/signature/budget issue,
  rewrites the request and retries (signature fields, thinking blocks, budget tokens).
- **Codex previous-response rectifier**: after a Codex upstream returns 400/404
  explicitly indicating the supplied `previous_response_id` is missing/invalid,
  removes only `previous_response_id` and retries the same provider once. This
  stale provider-scoped continuation error must not increment circuit failure
  counts or trigger cooldown for the newly selected provider.

Each rectifier must:

- be guarded (enabled flag + path checks)
- record a `special_settings_json` entry describing what happened (without secrets)
- have unit tests for edge cases (empty arrays, missing fields, etc.)

---

## Observability Contract

For troubleshooting "why did this request fail", the gateway relies on:

- request logs (`request_logs`, `request_attempt_logs`)
- structured gateway logs (`emit_gateway_log`)
- `special_settings_json` (per request) to record transformations

New/important `special_settings_json` markers include:

- `claude_auth_injection` (x-api-key default; 401/403 → Bearer fallback)
- `billing_header_rectifier`
- `claude_metadata_user_id_injection`
- `claude_model_mapping`
- `model_route_mapping`
- `thinking_signature_rectifier`
- `thinking_budget_rectifier`
- `codex_session_id_completion`
- `codex_previous_response_id_rectifier`

Never include secrets (API keys, bearer tokens, refresh tokens) in any of these surfaces.

`model_route_mapping` records Codex requested-vs-returned model routing only when
the requested route and observed/inferred returned route differ. It includes
`requestedModel`, `requestedReasoningEffort`, `requestedReasoningEffortSource`,
`actualModel`, `actualReasoningEffort`, `actualReasoningEffortSource`,
`modelMismatch`, `effortMismatch`, `providerId`, and `providerName`. All response
paths must observe the upstream route before protocol bridge, response fixer,
or plugin mutation. When the upstream explicitly returns a reasoning effort,
it must be marked with `actualReasoningEffortSource: "response"`. Otherwise,
the actual effort may be inferred from known model defaults only when the
request also relied on its model default; that inference must be marked with
`actualReasoningEffortSource: "model_default"`. If the request used an explicit
effort override and the response omits effort, the actual effort remains unknown.

### Provider Gates, Skipped Attempts, and Terminal Logs

Provider gates run before an upstream request is sent. Circuit-open, cooldown,
and provider limit checks may append a skipped `FailoverAttempt` for diagnostics,
but that skipped attempt is not a real provider request.

Required behavior:

- `outcome=skipped` means the provider was not called.
- Skipped attempts may appear in `attempts_json` and route diagnostics.
- All gate-only skips must finalize as `GW_ALL_PROVIDERS_UNAVAILABLE`.
- `GW_UPSTREAM_ALL_FAILED` is reserved for requests where at least one upstream
  call was actually attempted and failed.
- The terminal request log should describe provider unavailability, not a failed
  upstream response from the skipped provider.
- Retry-after/recent-error cache should short-circuit repeated identical
  unavailable requests where possible.

Forbidden pattern:

- Do not let skipped circuit-breaker attempts look like new upstream attempts in
  summary/detail UI.
- Do not use the last skipped provider as the user-facing final provider without
  also exposing the terminal unavailable state.

### Codex SSE Tail Errors After Completion

Codex `/v1/responses` streams can complete successfully from the user's
perspective and still surface a late read error while the gateway is draining
the tail. If the gateway has already observed stream output plus
`response.completed` and/or usage, that tail read error must not be rewritten
into `GW_STREAM_ERROR`/502 just because the socket closed during teardown.

Contract:

- Keep the terminal request log aligned with the user-visible stream result.
- Treat late tail read errors as transport noise once completion/usage has been
  observed for a 2xx Codex responses stream.
- Preserve the raw stream-read failure in debug logs or attempt details if
  needed, but do not surface it as the final user-facing request failure.
- Verify this path separately from terminal marker detection; a stream can have
  no error marker and still fail late during body drain.


### Failover Run State and Request Completion

#### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: gateway failover state or request-end finalization changes.
- Scope: `failover_loop` terminal classification and request-end event/log writes.

#### 2. Signatures

- `FailoverRunState`: owns `attempts`, `failed_provider_ids`, and `last_outcome` for one failover run.
  Owner: `src-tauri/src/gateway/proxy/handler/failover_loop/context.rs`.
- `AttemptOutcome`: stores the terminal error pair as one atomic value:
  `error_category` + `error_code`.
- `RequestEndContextArgs`: stores request context only: deps, trace id, CLI,
  method/path/query, stats exclusion, duration, attempts, special settings,
  session/model, and timestamps.
- `RequestCompletion`: stores request-end completion fields:
  `status`, `error_category`, `error_code`, TTFB fields, usage fields.
  Owner: `src-tauri/src/gateway/proxy/request_end.rs`.
- Constructors: `success(...)`, `failure(...)`, `failure_with_ttfb(...)`, and
  `client_abort()` are the canonical ways to describe proxy terminal outcomes.
- `StreamRequestCompletion`: stores stream tail completion fields as one value:
  `error_code`, `ttfb_ms`, `requested_model`, `usage_metrics`, and `usage`.
  Owner: `src-tauri/src/gateway/streams/request_end.rs`.
- Constructors: `success(...)`, `failure(...)`, and `from_error_code(...)` are
  the canonical ways to describe stream tail outcomes.

#### 3. Contracts

- Failover code must not maintain separate `last_error_category` and
  `last_error_code` variables. They can drift when one branch updates only one field.
- Attempt failure handlers must write `AttemptOutcome` in one assignment.
- Terminal finalizers must pass completion data through
  `RequestEndArgs::with_completion(RequestCompletion::...)` when status, error,
  TTFB, or usage fields describe one terminal state.
- Call sites must build request-end data with
  `RequestEndArgs::from_context(RequestEndContextArgs { ... })`, then apply
  `.with_completion(RequestCompletion::...)`.
- Direct `RequestEndArgs` struct literals are forbidden outside `request_end.rs`.
  Call sites must not set terminal status/error/TTFB/usage fields directly.
- `RequestEndArgs` can still carry non-completion context such as trace id,
  path, attempts, special settings, session id, requested model, and timestamps.
- Client-abort logging must use `RequestCompletion::client_abort()` so abort
  status, category, and code stay consistent across event and log output.
- Stream tee/relay/timing finalizers must pass tail state through
  `StreamRequestCompletion::success(...)`, `failure(...)`, or
  `from_error_code(...)`; do not pass loose `error_code`, `ttfb`, model, and
  usage arguments to stream request-end sinks.

#### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- All candidates skipped before upstream send -> status `503`, code
  `GW_ALL_PROVIDERS_UNAVAILABLE`, category `NULL`.
- At least one upstream call attempted and every provider failed -> status `502`,
  code from `last_outcome.error_code` or fallback `GW_UPSTREAM_ALL_FAILED`.
- Last attempt has a category -> request event and request log must use the same
  category/code pair.
- Missing `last_outcome` on all-failed finalization -> category `NULL`, fallback
  code `GW_UPSTREAM_ALL_FAILED`.

#### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: system error handler records
  `AttemptOutcome::new(category.as_str(), error_code)` once after the attempt log
  is built.
- Base: skip-only attempts keep full diagnostic attempts but finalize as
  unavailable instead of upstream all failed.
- Bad: updating category in one helper and code in another helper, then building
  request end from two independent options.

#### 6. Tests Required

- Unit-test `FailoverRunState::new()` owns empty attempts, empty failed ids, and
  empty last outcome.
- Unit-test `AttemptOutcome` preserves category and code as one terminal pair.
- Unit-test `RequestCompletion` constructors for success, failure with TTFB,
  and client abort.
- Grep-check request-end call sites for `RequestEndArgs {` after changes; only
  `request_end.rs` may construct the private struct directly.
- Unit-test `StreamRequestCompletion` constructors for success and failure, and
  assert stream error code, TTFB, requested model, usage metrics, and usage stay
  together as one terminal object.
- Regression-test skip-only classification remains unavailable.

#### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```rust
last_error_category = Some(category.as_str());
last_error_code = Some(error_code);
```

Correct:

```rust
last_outcome = Some(AttemptOutcome::new(category.as_str(), error_code));
```

### Request Log Two-Phase Write Lifecycle

For Claude `/v1/messages` requests, the gateway writes request logs in two phases:

1. **Placeholder** (request start): `status=NULL, duration_ms=0, attempts_json='[]'`
   - Written via `enqueue_in_progress_request_log_if_needed()` in `handler/mod.rs`
     (`src-tauri/src/gateway/proxy/handler/mod.rs`)
   - Purpose: let the frontend show "in progress" immediately
2. **Finalization** (request end): `status=200/499/..., duration_ms=actual, ...`
   - Written via `emit_request_event_and_enqueue_request_log()` in `request_end.rs`
     (`src-tauri/src/gateway/proxy/request_end.rs`)
   - Uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT(trace_id) DO UPDATE` to overwrite the placeholder

**Known failure mode**: If the finalization write is lost (app crash, buffered
writer backpressure drop), the placeholder persists with `status=NULL`
indefinitely. The frontend applies a 10-minute staleness guard
(`STALE_IN_PROGRESS_THRESHOLD_MS` in
`src/components/home/HomeLogShared.tsx`) to treat stale placeholders as
abandoned. Backend orphan cleanup is not yet implemented.

Frontend consumers must keep realtime events and history rows aligned. If a
request-log display changes, trace the whole path:

`src-tauri/src/gateway/events.rs` → `src-tauri/src/infra/request_logs.rs` →
`src/generated/bindings.ts` → `src/services/gateway/requestLogs.ts` →
`src/components/home/HomeLogShared.tsx` / `src/components/home/RequestLogDetailDialog.tsx`.
